I've succesfully managed to save all of the pictures from the 14th Canadian General Hospital war diaries

http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=2005110&rec_nbr_list=3366167,3203123,2005097,2005100,2005101,2005099,2005096,2005110,2005108,2005106

This, of course, was done in an "acceptable and respectful manner".
