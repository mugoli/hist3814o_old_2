# Module 3

### Exercise 1

* I am having a lot of trouble with this exercise. I have been trying this for over two hours, and simply can not manage to get things right.
* When I look for the data in texas.txt, it already comes with tidles in front
* When I attempt to save the file, it saves as an html file, rather than a file where all the data is cleaned.
I have not been keeping track of each and every single step of the process, so I will attempt to chronicle this again.
