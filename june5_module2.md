Module 2 Notes

Exercise 1: The Dream Case 

Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Find War Dead database research
Searched for my last name, Samba.
Found 22 records: https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-war-dead/results?lastName=Samba
Note: Samba is an extremely common name across numerous African countries, most results show people from Gambia, Sierra Leone, the "Gold Coast," etc.

Exercise 2
Need to markdown all the stuff that I did
I've succesfully managed to save all of the pictures from the 14th Canadian General Hospital wa$http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&r$This, of course, was done in an "acceptable and respectful manner".


Exercise 3:

STILL NEED TO DO TEI EXERCISE

Exercise 4:

This exercise was quite interesting. In all honesty, I used to think the information at the end of a link indicated the specific location of a file on a website, rather than it being an API command that asked the host server/computer to pull-up information in a particular way.
The API support page (http://search.canadiana.ca/support/api) was cool to look into!

In this exercise, I pulled data from 1800-1802 from the Canadian Discovery Portal, using the &fmt=json search query (API) at the end of the link. 
Then created a program to pull all the oochim numbers, which would allow me to save the individual files.

Exercise 5:

I tried downloading an older version of Twarc with no success.
I got the following error message:
"sudo: pip: command not found"
I will look into this further as Twitter truly is a data field I am interested in, both for this class as well as for future research.

Exercise 6

Will continue soon!!!
